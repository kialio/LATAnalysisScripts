	Fermi LAT Analysis Scripts (version 0.2.0)

The Fermi Science Tools (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc) are a suite
of tools developed for the analysis of both Fermi LAT and data. This
suite was developed by the FSSC and the instrument teams, and was
reviewed by the Fermi Users' Group.  The LATAnalysisScripts module is
a set of python modules to facilitate the analysis of LAT data.

To install:

   # verify that the Fermi Science tools are properly installed and
   # set up

   # unpack the source tar file and change to the source directory
   > tar zxvf LATAnalysisScripts-0.2.0.tar.gz
   > cd LATAnalysisScripts-0.2.0

   # install in the default python directory in the Fermi Science
   # tools directory
   > python setup.py install

To run:
   
   # start up python
   > python
   >>> from quickAnalysis import *
   >>> qA = quickAnalysis()
   ...

or

   # from the command line
   > quickAnalysis

You might want to run

    > quickAnalysis -i

to generate an example config file before you run the scripts.

The LAT Analysis Scripts are a collection of four modules
(quickAnalysis, quickLike, quickCurve and quickPlot) as well as a
helper module called quickUtils.  For more information and help on
these individual modules check the documentation.

From the command line:

   > pydoc quickAnalysis

or 

   > quickAnalysis -h

or from python:

   > python
   >>> help(quickAnalysis)

The setup.py install will install the LATAnalysisScripts into the
FERMI_DIR python directory if you have set up the Fermi Science Tools
prior to the install process.
