	Fermi LAT Analysis Scripts (version 0.1.8)

The Fermi Science Tools (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc) are a suite
of tools developed for the analysis of both Fermi LAT and GBM
data. This suite was developed by the FSSC and the instrument teams,
and was reviewed by the Fermi Users' Group.  The LATAnalysisScripts
module is a set of python modules to facilitate the analysis of LAT
data.  This package depends on the Fermi Science Tools and the pyds9
package which can be found at http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/.  You
also need to locate the make2FGLxml.py module in your PYTHONPATH.
Usually this is done by copying it into
$FERMI_DIR/lib/python2.6/site-packages/.

To install:

   # verify that you have installed pyds9 and that the Fermi
   # Science tools are properly installed and set up

   # unpack the source tar file and change to the source directory
   > tar zxvf LATAnalysisScripts-0.1.0.tar.gz
   > cd LATAnalysisScripts-0.1.0

   # install in the default python directory in the Fermi Science
   # tools directory
   > python setup.py install

To run:
   
   # start up python
   > python
   >>> from quickAnalysis import *
   >>> qA = quickAnalysis()
   ...

or

   # from the command line
   > quickAnalysis

You might want to run

    > quickAnalysis -c 

to generate an example config file before you run the scripts.

The LAT Analysis Scripts are a collection of three modules
(quickAnalysis, quickLike and quickPlot) as well as a helper module
called quickUtils.  For more information and help on these individual
modules check the documentation.

From the command line:

   > pydoc quickAnalysis

or from python:

   > python
   >>> help(quickAnalysis)

The setup.py install will install the LATAnalysisScripts into the
FERMI_DIR python directory if you have set up the Fermi Science Tools
prior to the install process.
